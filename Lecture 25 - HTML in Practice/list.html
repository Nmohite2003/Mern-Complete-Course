      <h2>Travelling To Jaipur</h2>
      <p>
        Jaipur, the Pink City of India, is filled with culture, history, and beautiful architecture.
        I visited the <b>Factory</b>, <b>Film Industry</b>, and attended a <b>Music Show</b> which reflected the rich
        traditions of Rajasthan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <u>Hawa Mahal</u> and <u>Amer Fort</u> were breathtaking. The local food and colorful markets
        made this journey unforgettable. I enjoyed meeting local artists and learning about their crafts.

      <h2>Studying With Reels</h2>
      <p>
        Social media can be both a distraction and a tool for learning. Iâ€™ve started watching educational
        reels that explain complex topics in a simple and creative way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of wasting time scrolling, I use platforms like Instagram and YouTube for quick
        coding tips, motivational videos, and career insights. Itâ€™s fun, fast, and useful!

      <h2>About My College Life</h2>
      <p>
        My college life at <b>JSPM BSIOTR</b> has been an incredible journey filled with growth, learning,
        and memories. From attending lectures to working on real-world projects, every experience has
        helped me become a better version of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The campus environment is vibrant, filled with students who inspire and support each other.
        Group studies, events, and coding competitions make college life truly enjoyable.

      <h2>My Hobby</h2>
      <p>
        I love traveling and photography. Capturing nature, city life, and candid moments through my camera
        gives me joy. Photography helps me slow down and appreciate small details around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy writing â€” sharing my thoughts through blogs like this helps me connect with people
        and express creativity freely.
